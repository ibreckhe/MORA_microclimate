MORA_microclimate Repository
========================================================

This is a repository for code used to clean and format microclimate data collected at Mt. Rainier National Park by the lab of Janneke Hille Ris Lambers at the University of Washington.

The scripts in this repository were authored by several people, including Mark Raleigh, Steve Kroiss, and Kevin Ford, and were adapted by Ian Breckheimer (ibreckhe@gmail.com).

The code to estimate snow duration from microclimate sensors was originally authored as a Matlab script by Mark Raleigh, and used in the publication:
